# apathetic rollups

similar to optimistic rollups, as in we accept updates "optimistically", but we're not concerned with immediate validity since they won't be able to prove it in the long run. tryna do away with proactive fraud proofs in optimistic rollups.

what can we do with adaptor signatures here?

anyone can append wtv they want to the state root, but a malicious party will never be able to prove an invalid withdrawal. apathetic rollups stop malicious actions at "exit time".
