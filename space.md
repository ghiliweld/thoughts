# spatial software

> Software applications can utilize spatial interfaces to afford users powerful ways of thinking and interacting. Though often associated with gaming, spatial interfaces can be useful in any kind of software, even in less obvious domains like productivity tools or work applications. We will see spatial interfaces move into all verticals, starting with game-like interfaces for all kinds of social use-cases.

spatial software seems to be the big trend for software in 2020, and a slew of new startups seem to have jumped on it almost at the same time w/o realizing it?
i find it exciting that apps are redefining how space works in their apps, removing borders and making space flexible for users.

tiktok and other apps of that ilk have already started the trend of providing excellent tools for content creation in a hyper-viral public plaza.
i'd say spatial software is a generalization of that, where users (given great tools) can shape their own experiences in their own spaces (private or public).
whereas on tiktok, no two videos might be the same but the experience on the app is still similar, spatial software gives users the power to change how an app is even used.
this is something i don't think has even been fully appreciated yet by the people early on this spatial software trend.

examples:
- [eternal](https://eternal.plus/)
- [muze](https://www.muze.nyc/)
- [makespace](https://makespace.fun/)

[the presence project](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-presence-project/id1463320998) is an innteresting twist on this. it doesn't let you modify the space how you want but it does allow you to feel others' *presence* in your space.

## where figma comes in
figma was built to be a design tool but it's actually very flexible and can be used for games and community building.

i want to build a space on figma that emulates pokemon diamond, complete with background music and alll the other goodies. a space in pokemon diamond that you can move around in, on a web app.
