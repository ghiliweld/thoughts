# local first software (lfs)

lfs is software that primarly works w/o any intermediate servers. [this blog post](https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/11/20/local-first-software/) does a great job at explaining it, but i'll do a write a quick summary on the benefits of lfs. for more, there's also an [in-depth paper](https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/local-first.pdf) on the topic.
- it's fast
- it works offline
- it's secure and private by default
- it gives users full ownership and control of their data
- it has longevity (low risk if your data being lost as a service shuts down)

the idea of lfs is pretty straightforward but sounds limited initially. but recent advances in p2p tech beg the question: **how far can we take lfs?**

is lfs philosophy and the current paradigm of everything being on the cloud mutually exclusive? can we attain viral network effects on a network that isn't connected through a central server?

one of my favourite examples of a social network (altho you wouldn't normally call it that) is streetpass mii plaza. walking around town with your 3ds would let you connect with other 3ds owners thru the streetpass mii plaza. streetpass was what nintendo called their technology for connecting with other nearby 3ds devices over bluetooth. i think a social network built on this today could be pretty powerful.
