# purpose
been thinking a lot about what i'm meant to do. what will i do and where will i go with what i've learned?

there's a lot i wanna do:
- building things that actually help people ([tweet](https://twitter.com/ghiliweld/status/1267670440509607937))
- help usher in a new more decentralized web with my work on [braid](braid.md)
- create interesting products at the intersection of academic ressearch and consumer tech, i think we can do a lot more with the research coming out of academia

i wrote this because i feel stuck in a rut, the goals i outlined above seem almost unnreachable. i think i can do it if i keep at it but i dunno how imma go about it at the moment.
