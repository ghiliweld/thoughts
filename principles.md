# Principles

## Theses

1. More can be done to bridge the gap between "techies" and "non-techies". Hiding away features or powers for the users convenience might be good UX, but it isn't great. Through education and great UX, "non-techies" can shape their own experience on the web. This is powerful.

## Product Design Tenets
- Ignore preconceived notions: preconceived notions get in the way of creating new things
- Build for efficiency: users should not be encouraged to stay for long stretches of time
- Build for interest: users should be encouraged to come back frequently
- Build the future you want to see
- Power for everyone: Every user should be able to become a power user, UX is key here

## Social Network Tenets
- Engagement >>> Metrics: promoting engagement (i.e. replies and other interactions) over likes, reposts and follows
- Local first:
- Private-first: Privacy is the best policy, users can choose to give others more access if they wish
- Non-addictive: Users should not be so hooked as to become addicted
- Hooks: Users should however, be hooked into being active on the platform
- Non-enclosing: Users should not have their identity and circles enclosed on the platform
- Safe and Civil: Users should be free to go about their business without fear for harassment or their safety
- Cutting fat: The platform should by design cull low quality content
