# Principles

## Theses

1. More can be done to bridge the gap between "techies" and "non-techies". Hiding away features or powers for the users convenience might be good UX, but it isn't great. Through education and great UX, "non-techies" can shape their own experience on the web. This is powerful.
2. The tech for creating magical experiences is already here. The creativity and daring to make it a reality is all that's missing.

## Product Design Tenets
- Ignore preconceived notions: preconceived notions get in the way of creating new things
- Form follows function: to add on the point above, design should suit the product, nothing more nothing less
- Ego is the downfall of a good product: remove your product from the equation, regardless of whether it's bad business to do  so. quiet products >>>>> attention-seeking products.
- accessibility = bug free: if it's not accessible to everyone, your product is buggy. go back and fix it.
- Build for efficiency: users should not be encouraged to stay for long stretches of time
- Build for interest: users should be encouraged to come back frequently
- Build the future you want to see
- Power for everyone: Every user should be able to become a power user, UX is key here

## Social Network Tenets
- Engagement >>> Metrics: promoting engagement (i.e. replies and other interactions) over likes, reposts and follows
- Local first: almost everything should be done locally, only the bare minimum of data should be sent remotely
- Private-first: Privacy is the best policy, users can choose to give others more access if they wish
- Non-addictive: Users should not be so hooked as to become addicted
- Hooks: Users should however, be hooked into being active on the platform
- Non-enclosing: Users should not have their identity and circles enclosed on the platform
- Safe and Civil: Users should be free to go about their business without fear for harassment or their safety
- Cutting fat: The platform should by design cull low quality content
