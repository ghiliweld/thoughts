# uniswap v3
- v3 allows for modeling arbitrary curves by aggregating liquidity accross positions
- instead of designing a fixed appropriate curve, v3 allows for liquidity distribution (and the resulting curve) to flow to it's most "natural form"
- the market for a pool will inform liquidity providers which will in turn inform the liquidity distribution

- each position is like a mini v2 pair
- range orders are possible, in the form of LP positions
