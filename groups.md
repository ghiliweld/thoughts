# Groups

Groups (which can refer to group chats, closed communities, etc...) are interesting because they're a space in social networks that are a lot more engaging, similar to the real world (or physical world, wtv you wanna call it). Unlike feeds and timelines, the interactions go further than simple likes and sparse comments. Groups may have their own memes (inside jokes/references) and the members are generally more tight-knit.

Group chats are an obvious example of this however groups can also be observed in with larger entities, such as subreddits or even Twitter spheres (Black Twitter for example). These groups each have their own memes, references and culture that makes for a more engaging social media experience.

## Rings

Rings are an extension of this concept of groups except every member in a ring is linked somehow. Subreddits and Discord servers for example wouldn't apply but group chats are perfect examples of rings. Another example of a ring can be circles of mutuals on Twitter. These mutuals follow each other, like, retweet and reply under each other's tweets.

### Group Theory: The Social Media Version

An emphasis on users forming groups with others instead of prioritizing large followings is key to a more engaging and healthy social media experience.
